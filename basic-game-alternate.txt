You wake up in your bed feeling well rested after a good’s night sleep.  The summer warmth has made your room awfully hot, so you head hurts slightly. Your room is completely dark and as usual, you’ve woken up slightly late. You quickly sit up, realising that you need to quickly get to school after eating the full English on your bed side table that your dad always leaves there before heading to work. \n \nYet, as you wake, you see a strange rectangular object that someone has left on the floor next to your bed. Some light from the window or overhead lights might be useful to examine it further.

You need to turn the light on, have your breakfast and pill, pick up the backpack and take the brick or put the brick in the backpack. Once that is done, you need the stick so you can push/pull the boulder and leave the room.

The brick is a standard red brick that your mum keeps in her work shed around the back of the house.

The boulder is a huge metallic boulder. It seems that it has been super-glued to the ground. You might be able to move it, but its at the very edge of what you could manage. However, without some long object to put under the boulder and push against the glue you have no chance. You also think back to the last time you helped mum out with a car repair and remember how important it was that you ate a big breakfast before that time.

Drof tells you to wave at every driver, and repeat what seems to be the ubiquitious greeting, "Praise be to Salta". After a few minutes, you arrive at the neighbourhood bar. You pass some robots in the smoking area who seem to be taking puffs from what looks like a power bank. Drof hurries you inside and you sit down at the bar. A robot arm places a beer in front of you.

Tceferp takes a deep breath and says, "You know, these people are actually robots. They call themselves Bostonian Saltases and they have been ordered to remove every inhabitant in town and lock up every house. All of this is to prepare for the demolition of the town to make space for an intercontinental super highway. Don't ask me how I know any of this. You don't want to know.". He continues “The only way these robots can be stopped is by playing their recall song. They've all been programmed to stop the project and return to base by their over lord if they hear one specific song”. Tceferp says that he has heard rumblings that the song may be called "Deplorable", but he most likely misheard this. "How does Drof know all of this?", you think before realizing that you need to act quickly to save your town.
