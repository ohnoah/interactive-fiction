turn light on
As you flick the light switch, you make out the object as a red brick. Someone also seems to have moved your hockey stick from the corner of the room next to your bed. To your surprise, you also see a large boulder blocking your doorway. “How did that end up there?”, you think as your heart rate jumps.

examine object
The brick is a standard red brick that your mum keeps in her work shed around the back of the house. It’s not that large and would easily fit in your backpack that you see sticking out under your bed next to the brick. As you are about to put the brick down, you see a small handwritten note under where the brick was.

examine boulder
The boulder is a huge metallic boulder. It seems that it has been super-glued to the ground. You might be able to move it, but its at the very edge of what you could manage. However, without some long object to put under the boulder and push against the glue you have no chance. You also think back to the last time you helped mum out with a car repair and remember how important it was that you ate a big breakfast before that time.

push boulder
You gather all your power to push the boulder out the way, which exposes your door ever so slightly so that you can open it and leave the room if you wish.

leave room
You leave the room and enter the living room. To add to your state of shock, you find that solid metallic bars have been placed on the inside of the three windows to the West, East and South. A small piece of paper with a note is on the table in strange handwriting.

examine west window
The window has a light green stain in the top-right in the same color as the juice your parents seemed to have left on the table. The window seems reinforced like the others, but the job seems sloppier. Maybe you could get out through it if you could find a way to break it with something heavy.

examine juice
You take a closer look at the juice and it seems to be some sort of chemical soup, not apple juice. It is bright, neon green like the stain on the window. The smell of it reminds you of hydrochloric acid from chemistry class.

throw backpack at west window
You throw the acid-coated bag at the window with all your force. The instant the bag touches the window the reinforcement seems to dissolve and a moment later the brick bag tumbles through the window to a loud crashing sound. Light pours in through the window and you can see the front of your garden.
