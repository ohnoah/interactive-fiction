# interactive-fiction
This is the source code repository for a Part II project titled "Knowledge-Based Interactive Fiction". The goal of the project was to combine knowledge-based techniques with modern NLP libraries to improve on current interactive fiction techniques.

The starting file is the EnhancedGamePlayer class which starts a Java Swing application where you can enter .ser file names of games you have created in the EnhancedGameEditor or the BasicGameEditor. Look to the source code documentation for instructions on how to design games using the Editor classes. You can only design games using the GameCompiler classes, which you can refer to the Game grammar for more information on. This is a sister-project to the Frames repository for Java which I have also released. That project includes only the classes used to implement a frame-based knowledge base, whereas this project contains the relevant code to interface with this knowledge-base to play and create IF Games.

All tests are available in the test folder, which should be run to test that the code is well-functioning.
