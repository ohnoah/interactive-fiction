You wake up in your bed feeling well rested after a good’s night sleep.  The summer warmth has made your room awfully hot, so you head hurts slightly. Your room is completely dark and as usual, you’ve woken up slightly late. You quickly sit up, realising that you need to quickly get to school after eating the full English on your bed side table that your dad always leaves there before heading to work. \n \nYet, as you wake, you see a strange rectangular object that someone has left on the floor next to your bed. Some light from the window or overhead lights might be useful to examine it further.

world::room := "antechamber"
% message
You enter the antechamber. There are many of these strange humanoids in the room and you see a door at the end of the room that seems to lead somewhere. You wonder how they could’ve built this into the bar so quickly. As you enter, a grayish-tinted robot whispers something to its conversation partner about a  pop-song in Spanish made in the 2010s and the room goes completely silent for a few seconds before the buzz of conversation returns.

You look at the door from a distance and notice there is no way you’ll be able to get there through the crowd of robots. Maybe the stairs are more interesting and you should leave this room.
