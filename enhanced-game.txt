You wake up in your bed feeling well rested after a good’s night sleep.  The summer warmth has made your room awfully hot, so you head hurts slightly. Your room is completely dark and as usual, you’ve woken up slightly late. You quickly sit up, realising that you need to quickly get to school after eating the full English on your bed side table that your dad always leaves there before heading to work. \n \nYet, as you waken, you see a strange rectangular object that someone has left on the floor next to your bed. Some light from the window or overhead lights might be useful to examine it further.

You open the curtain and light rushes into the room. Yet, your hand briefly touches the window and it feels unusual. As the room grows lighter, you make out the object next to your bed as a red brick. To your surprise, you also see a large boulder blocking your doorway. “How did that end up there?”, you think as your heart rate jumps.

The brick is a standard red brick that your mum keeps in her work shed around the back of the house. It’s not that large and would easily fit in your backpack that you see sticking out under your bed next to the brick. As you are about to put the brick down, you see a small handwritten note under where the brick was.
You squint but can't make out anything about the object in the dark.

The driver is a white humanoid robot, who seems surprised that you are there but only yells for you to get out the way as he moves the construction towards the second floor windows of your house. \nAll of a sudden, your friend Tcefer Drof from school emerges in your garden. He throws you a onepiece which resembles a halloween costume one-piece of the white humanoid robot in the bulldozer-like machine. He yells “Put the one-piece on quickly, or we’re screwed”.

As you yell explicatives and questions at him, he shakes his head slowly and yells back at you to follow him and ask questions later. On the way, you see 4 more bulldozer-sized reinforcement machines going away at houses. Drof tells you to wave at every driver, and repeat what seems to be the ubiquitious greeting, "Praise be to Salta". After a few minutes, you arrive at the neighbourhood bar. You pass some robots in the smoking area who seem to be taking puffs from what looks like a power bank. Drof hurries you inside and you sit down at the bar.

Tceferp takes a deep breath and says, "You know, these people are actually robots. They call themselves Bostonian Saltases and they have been ordered to remove every inhabitant in town and lock up every house. All of this is to prepare for the demolition of the town to make space for an intercontinental super highway. Don't ask me how I know any of this. You don't want to know.". He continues “The only way these robots can be stopped is by playing their recall song. They've all been programmed to stop the project and return to base by their over lord if they hear one specific song”. Tceferp says that he has heard rumblings that the song may be called "Deplorable", but he most likely misheard this. "How does Drof know all of this?", you think before realizing that you need to act quickly to save your town. Drf points you to the back of the room, explaining that he thinks the recall speaker can be found somewhere here.
