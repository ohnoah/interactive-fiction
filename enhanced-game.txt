You wake up in your bed feeling well rested after a good’s night sleep.  The summer warmth has made your room awfully hot, so you head hurts slightly. Your room is completely dark and as usual, you’ve woken up slightly late. You quickly sit up, realising that you need to quickly get to school after eating the full English on your bed side table that your dad always leaves there before heading to work. \n \nYet, as you waken, you see a strange rectangular object that someone has left on the floor next to your bed. Some light from the window or overhead lights might be useful to examine it further.

The brick is a standard red brick that your mum keeps in her work shed around the back of the house. It’s not that large and would easily fit in your backpack that you see sticking out under your bed next to the brick. As you are about to put the brick down, you see a small handwritten note under where the brick was.
You squint but can't make out anything about the object in the dark.

Tceferp takes a deep breath and says, "You know, these people are actually robots. They call themselves Bostonian Saltases and they have been ordered to remove every inhabitant in town and lock up every house. All of this is to prepare for the demolition of the town to make space for an intercontinental super highway. Don't ask me how I know any of this. You don't want to know.". He continues “The only way these robots can be stopped is by playing their recall song. They've all been programmed to stop the project and return to base by their over lord if they hear one specific song”. Tceferp says that he has heard rumblings that the song may be called "Deplorable", but he most likely misheard this. "How does Drof know all of this?", you think before realizing that you need to act quickly to save your town.

You make your way to the back of the room where you sit down and immediately get served a plate of tapas. The robotic bartender forgets to clear the table of an old plate of tortillas next to you, which annoys you slightly even though you have much bigger problems to worry about right now. To the right, there is an entrance to an antechamber of some sort and to the left is a staircase leading up to the staff area and kitchen of the bar.

You play Depasito in the vinyl player. The parabol dish makes some strange noises for a few seconds until you hear a cheesy guitar riff play outside. The sound from outside seems like its being broadcast from space to the whole town. As you look out the window, you see the city's invading robots mounting their bulldozer-like machines and driving off in myriad directions. You have saved the day, and saved your town. \n Thanks for playing this game.
